# Zeeve Internship Learnings

Projects, notes etc.

Till now, some projects initiated here, and have grown mature enough to go on as individual repos..., honourable mentions include:

* [os-cashier](https://github.com/adi-g15/the-os-cashier) - A blockchain application, envisioning a distributed computer (kind of in a simple way... just increase balance of anyone who profits the system, hence the 'cashier' in name)
* [crypto-testbed](https://github.com/adi-g15/crypto-testbed) - _Now_ it is a coexistence of C++, Rust, Python and Javascript code, using different ways to call methods in other languages, ie. FFI/bindings, gRPC and zmq (tcp). This was just meant for learning as Sankalp sir give out some cryptography concepts, and initially was named "crypt_tasks"... and... was very much simpler... NOW IS INTENTIONALLY much Complex (than should be for something like that)

Some existed before this... ie. the [notes](https://github.com/adi-g15/notes) repo, and all notes added to the submodule here, will get merged/pushed to upstream.

Some still co-exist, ie. the sawtooth forks... they actually have different repos but none of them get directly edited there.
