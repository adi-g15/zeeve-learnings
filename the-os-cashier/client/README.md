# Initial Idea

> This maynot reflect current code, I just write 'initial' plans, will update the README again after it's completed

It will have -> 

* list
* reg <user>
* plug <user> <module>
* unplug <user> <module>

> module will be stored in a map, with each entry as "module_name -> performance_number"
