## Operations -

See `client/src/main.rs` for options, this maynot be updated

Two primary operations:

Plug: Plug in module		(Costs CPU coins)
Unplug: Unplug a module

For users:

Reg: Register user
List: Lists users

**Asset Name: CPUCoin 🖱️**

### Ownership and transfer of assets

Creation of CPUCoin: If a user's plugging in the module, benefitted performance, then the difference from a given average is created as a CPUCoin

Initially for each user, the OS generates 10 CPUCoins and give it to them

Ownership: To the owner that plugged the module

Transfer: If a user plugs in a costly module (in terms of performance, wrt to the average), then the difference or the amount left (whichever is higher) is transfered to the OS (the application)

> All of these are per seconds, ie. the creation and transfer
>
> As it is either reused or created, it only ever grows
