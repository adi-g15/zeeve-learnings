# The OS Cashier

My idea for the application:

Two operations:
Plug: Plug in module		(Costs CPU coins)
Unplug: Unplug a module

Asset: CPUCoin

### Ownership and transfer of assets

Creation of CPUCoin: If a user's plugging in the module, benefitted performance, then the difference from a given average is created as a CPUCoin

Initially for each user, the OS generates 10 CPUCoins and give it to them

Ownership: To the owner that plugged the module

Transfer: If a user plugs in a costly module (in terms of performance, wrt to the average), then the difference or the amount left (whichever is higher) is transfered to the OS (the application)

> All of these are per seconds, ie. the creation and transfer
> As it is either reused or created, it only ever grows
